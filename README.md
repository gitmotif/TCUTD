# TCUTD
Version 1


Thought that, for the 10th anniversary (which is today as I'm writing this), I would make something that I wanted to have back in 2016, when I got into the community.
Think of this as an offline Flowey's, but worse and more limited.

## Future Additions
Presets for save files? Such as being able to go fight Sans, Omega Flowey, Undyne the Undying and so on

## Also.
Before you think that this is a virus that's going to blow your PC to dust, I put it through Virustotal (You're welcome.)
If. This still isn't enough proof, you can put it through Virustotal...

## Thank you Toby
