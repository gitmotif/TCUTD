# TCUTD
Version 1


Thought that, for the 10th anniversary (which is today as I'm writing this), I would make something that I wanted to have back in 2016, when I got into the community.
Think of this as an offline Flowey's, but worse and more limited.

## Future Additions
Presets for save files? Such as being able to go fight Sans, Omega Flowey, Undyne the Undying and so on

## Thank you Toby
 _Happy 10th Anniversary UT! and thank you Toby Fox for making such a great game!_
